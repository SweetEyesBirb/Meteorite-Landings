                <p>Meteorite landings map is a small project from a first year Computer Science student aiming at
                    practicing to fetch JSON data from a dataset and its consequent manipulation.</p>

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>The data is fetched from the NASA dataset API and displayed on the map powered by Leaflet JS. The
                    clustering is made possible via Leaflet.markercluster, a Leaflet JS plugin.</p>
                    <p>Zoom in the map to a location to break the clusers, click on a marker to explore the fascinating world of meteorites with this interactive map that shows the locations, dates, names and sizes of meteorite landings around the world fell or found from 861 AD to 2013. Learn about the origin, composition, and impact of these cosmic rocks that have fallen to Earth.</p>

                <h2>The Data</h2>
                <p>There are around 45700 entries, but only around 39500 are displayed on the map. This is because about
                    6200 objects have no coordinates, therefore they would be grouped in one single point. Trying to
                    open this large cluster could cause the page to stop working, therefore, I have decided to omit the
                    data of these objects.
                    <br><br>In Antartica, three big clusters on the same coordinates respectively can be found. 1505 meteorite fragments belong to Asuka, 4761 to Yamato and 3040 to Queen Alexandra Range. Opening these clusters may take some time.
                </p>

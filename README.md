# Meteorite-Landings

## Goal
This is a small project from a first year CS student that was aiming at practicing fetching JSON data from a dataset and its consequent manipulation.

## Info
The website displays all the meteorite landings from the NASA dataset at https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh.

-**Due to the large number of objects (around 45000), the markers on the page may take a while to spawn, usually between 10 to 40 seconds depending on the processing power of the device.**
- Clicking on very large clusters may cause the page to crash. Zoom in instead.
- **The very large cluster at lat: 0, lng:0 (South West of Nigeria) is a collection of all the objects with no coordinates. Opening this cluster may cause interruptions.**

## Attributions and resources
- The map was rendered via Leaflet library in JS https://leafletjs.com/.
- Clustering was made possible because of this repo https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster.
